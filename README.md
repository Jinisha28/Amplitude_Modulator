# Amplitude_Modulator
The AM modulator circuit is made up simple resistor network mixer (10kΩ, 0.47Ω) and the diode(1N4148). The modulating signal (Vm) and carrier signal (Vc) are applied to the resistive network mixer. Then the mixed signal enters the non-linear diode element. The diode causes nonlinear mixing of the two-input signal. The output from the diode mixer is a rectified am signal.
If the modulating signal or message signal (Vm) is a cosine wave of frequency 1KHz, carrier signal (Vc) is a cosine wave of 10KHz then the resulting signal from the single diode mixer is a rectified amplitude modulated signal of 10KHz
