The AM modulation is a kind of modulation technique which is in use since the very early days of wireless data transmission.
The amplitude modulation is the simplest modulation technique among the wide verity of modulation techniques in use. 
The amplitude modulation of a high frequency signal is easy to achieve and the demodulation is also simple compared to other techniques. 
The high frequency signal which is modulated to carry the low frequency audio signals are called ‘carrier frequency’ and the audio signals used for
modulation is called ‘modulating signal’ or ‘message signal’ or ‘base band signal’.
